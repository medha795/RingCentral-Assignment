# SQLAlchemy

## Project Overview
I  used SQLAlchemy, and a Flask API called, `climate_app.py`, to perform and pull climate data from the `hawaii.sqlite` weather station tables. Data analyis was performed using Python and Pandas (Jupyter Notebook). 
Only issue, I faced with this assignment is I do not know how to create a python package with the code I have and create documentation for it etc.
